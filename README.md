# Wishlist - Node

## Getting Started

First, create a <code>.env</code> file in the root folder following the <code>.env.example</code> sample.

After, install the project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will be running at http://localhost:5050 where 5050 is the env port.
